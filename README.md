WP Basic Plugin Template
===========================

A starting point for writing WP plugins.

Usage
-----

1. Download the archive in wp-content/plugins and extract it.
2. Rename the folder to something more meaningfull.
3. You may also want to rename the PluginTemplate.php, /lib/PluginTemplate.php and /view/dashboard/plugin_template.php wi something more suited to your project.
4. Change the PluginTemplate::prefix value to a something nice and sweet.
5. Start coding.

Notes
-----
This may not be ideal for you, or maybe even for me. It is the first iterations with a structure that I find sane at the time being. Will be updated in the future, if I feel the need to.
